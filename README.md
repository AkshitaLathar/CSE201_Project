# CSE201_Project

Hi all,

This is the course project for CSE201, Miami University.
Update by Bingfan Tian.

Guys, please follow this page to download and initialize your visual studio to run our web application code. Use your VS to run RazorPagesShowSearcher.sln file. It is in \RazorPagesShowSearcher.

Then, you can download the git desktop to make pull and push process easier. Here is a link.

***The result of the current code compilation is automatically generated. I have not modified the page style according to our design. I still keep most of my attention on the class files. I will continue to update our code next week. For me, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday are relatively free. I will update my local latest code in these days. Be sure to check the codebase at midnight these days to make sure you download the newest code.

***At the same time, I have not linked Tianyi's database with my code. The database used by the current code is a locally initialized database. When you open the Shows page, you may get a blank page. Don't worry, you can add the test data you need to your local database.

***Testers, please spend some time reading this page. I am very sorry that it took me a long time to find the right path. I hope this page is helpful for your testing work!
